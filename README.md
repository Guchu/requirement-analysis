### Scope:
Includes: property listing, management, search, booking, viewing, payment, notifications, and analytics.
Excludes: travel routing, airline integrations, and in-depth pricing optimization.

### Stakeholders:

Property Managers / Hotel Owners

Customers / Guests

Administrators / Business Analysts

External Systems (Payment gateways, Notification services)

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, interpreting, and documenting the needs of stakeholders to define what a software system must achieve. It acts as the foundation for the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring that the final product aligns with user expectations and business objectives.  

This phase goes beyond writing down features‚Äîit focuses on understanding the problem space, exploring possible solutions, and setting clear boundaries for the project.


### Importance in the SDLC
1. Clarity of Vision  
   - Helps both developers and stakeholders agree on what the system will deliver, reducing misunderstandings.  

2. Early Risk Identification  
   - Potential challenges such as scalability, security, or performance bottlenecks can be addressed before they become expensive problems.  

3. Efficient Resource Utilization  
   - By knowing exactly what needs to be built, teams avoid unnecessary work and can prioritize the most valuable features.  

4. Improved Communication  
   - Provides a shared reference point (requirements document) that keeps developers, designers, testers, and product owners aligned.  

5. Stronger Quality Assurance  
   - Test cases can be designed directly from the documented requirements, ensuring the final product meets user needs.  


### Role in the Development Lifecycle
  - Requirement Analysis sits at the very start of the SDLC and influences all subsequent phases:  
  - Design Architecture and UI/UX decisions are guided by well-defined requirements.  
  - Development: Clear requirements reduce scope creep and rework.  
  - Testing: QA teams validate the product against the documented requirements.  
  - Deployment & Maintenance: Requirements help evaluate whether future changes align with the original business goals.  

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Prevents Misunderstandings and Miscommunication 
   Requirement Analysis ensures that stakeholders, developers, and testers all share the same understanding of what the system is supposed to achieve. Without this clarity, teams risk building features that do not align with user needs or business goals.

2. Reduces Development Costs and Rework  
   Identifying and resolving issues during the requirement phase is far less costly than discovering them during coding or testing. Well-documented requirements minimize the chances of scope creep, rework, and wasted resources.

3. Provides a Basis for Design and Testing  
   Clear requirements act as a blueprint for system architecture and user interface design. They also provide measurable criteria for quality assurance, enabling testers to verify that the final product matches stakeholder expectations.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
### Requirement Gathering 
Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

### Requirement Elicitation ‚úçÔ∏è
Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements. 
### Requirement Documentation üìö
Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user‚Äôs perspective.
Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

### Requirement Analysis and Modeling üìä
Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

### Requirement Validation ‚úÖ
Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

## Types of Requirements.
### Functional Requirements
Definition: Describe what the system should do.
Examples: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

Key Functional Requirements:

Search Properties: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
User Registration: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
Property Listings: Display properties with essential details and images.
Booking System: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration process for users.

### Non-functional Requirements
Definition: Describe how the system should perform.
Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

Key Non-functional Requirements:

Performance: The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
Security: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
Usability: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
Reliability: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.

## Use Case Diagrams.
What are Use Case Diagrams?

Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases)

Creating Use Case Diagrams:

Identify actors (e.g., guest, registered user, admin).
Define use cases (e.g., search properties, book property, manage listings).
Draw interactions between actors and use cases.
Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:

Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.
